				<h2>LEARNING APP'S</h2>
				<p> <strong> The first learning_app </strong> use library paper.js to draw some shapes and an html form to introduce some parameters, but don't runs. </p>
				<p> <strong> The second learning_app </strong> use library processing.min.js and an html form to introduce some parameters. We mix some processing and javascripts instructions to draw shapes with few inputs.</p>
				<p> <strong> The third learning_app </strong> use a library savetextasfile.js in order to save a text into a file with .gcode extension. Text saved should be input into a textarea<br>This library is not Filesaver.js because i haven't reached with it, yet. Savetextasfile.js is created from an idea in <a href="http://www.forosdelweb.com/f13/como-guardar-txt-javascript-1110956" title="my 1st app">www.forosdelweb.com/</a></p>
				<p> <strong> The fourth learning_app </strong> is based on the second one in order to calculate ordered main points of a shape, and show them.</p>
				<p> <strong> The fifth learning_app </strong> is based on the third and fourth learning app. Now processing instructions are not in HTML file, are in his generic format .pde. Moreover we can save ordered points to a file with extension .gcode clicking a button. </p>
				<p> <strong> The sixth learning_app </strong> is based on the fifth learning app. Now you can download a file .gcode with language g-code. This file is available for Square, Triangle and Circle shapes.</p>
				<p> <strong> The seventh learning_app </strong> is based on the sixth learning app. File gcode is available for a new shape as a Star. Moreover you can select feedrate of 3D printer and initial height</p>
				<p> <strong> The eighth learning_app </strong> is based on the seventh learning app. We has added  material and nozzle diameters in html form, in order to calculate extrusion values in gcode. Also we has added Build up and release pressure for printer</p>	
				<p> <strong> The ninth learning_app </strong> is based on the eighth learning app. We has change the structure of files in order to improve compatibility with main browsers. Now we don't use native extension of Processing (.pde), and processing instructions and javascript instructions are mixed on a file with extension .js as a javascript library</p>	
				<p> <strong> The tenth learning_app </strong> is based on the ninth learning app. We has added the layer height and the number of layers in html form, in order to get a gcode able to move printer in Z axis. Since this, it's <strong> my first 2.5D dessign App</strong>. Moreover, we has ordered form inputs and you can choose filename to download file (.gcode)</p>	
				<p> <strong> The eleventh learning_app </strong> is based on the tenth learning app. We has added 3 more shapes (Flower / Rounded Star / Heart) based on parametric formulas. For each shape only we need one more parameter on form</p>
				<br>
				<h2>3DdateFP</h2>
				<p> <strong> 3DdateFP-RANDOM </strong> is my first App that plays with 2 shapes: one inside and the other outside and is to test the interaction with user and to test the composition of 2 shapes. Gcode is not available. The goal of the App is that from the input of an special date generates a design with 2 shapes, and that user can download the gcode. Also user will be able to change the settings to construct the gcode</p>
				<p> <strong> 3DdateFP</strong> is my first App that you can input and special date and since this the program generates automatically 2 shapes. Gcode is not available yet. Also it's possible to print design generated. </p>
