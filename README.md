# myrepository_3dc
WHO? I'm David Vilella, student of a Multimedia degree at UOC (UNIVERSITAT OBERTA DE CATALUNYA).

WHY? The reason i'm doing this repository is because nowadays i'm collaborating in 3DC (3digitalcooks) as a subject of the degree.

WHAT? Our goal is to make a basic dessign app for 3d food printers, that with few inputs from user, we can visualyze a 2D or 3D design and to save this design into a file .gcode that printers 3D can understand.

I'm excited with the experience ! 3D food printing seems a magical question for me! and i'm sure i will learn a lot !
